- **Diagnostic UI**: Redesigned `BootloaderManagerWindow` with improved feedback during the flashing process.

### Fixed
- **Watchdog Conflict Mitigation**: Implemented specific handling for hardware watchdogs to ensure stable handoff between bootloader and application.
- **UI Responsiveness**: Addressed potential UI hangs during high-traffic CAN diagnostic phases.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **Modular Settings Architecture**: Refactored the consolidated settings panel into a hierarchical structure with dedicated ViewModels (`Advanced`, `Calibration`, `Display`, `Filter`) for improved maintainability.
- **Advanced Display Options**: Introduced new customization settings for UI layout and data visualization.
- **Bootloader Diagnostics**: Enhanced firmware update process with detailed diagnostic feedback and progress tracking.
- **Legacy Feature Parity**: Restored missing UI elements, status displays, and keyboard shortcuts from legacy versions to the new MVVM architecture.

### Changed
- **Weight Processing Engine**: Significant updates to the processing logic for better stability and noise reduction.
- **Service Registry Refactor**: Streamlined dependency injection and service management for better performance.
- **Updater Reliability**: Comprehensive updates to the `ATS_TwoWheeler_Updater` for seamless background updates.
- **UI Performance**: Optimized logging and monitor windows to prevent UI thread contention during high-speed data streaming.

### Fixed
- **UI Synchronization**: Resolved issues where dashboard elements and status indicators would occasionally desync.
- **Communication Robustness**: Fixed potential race conditions in `CANService` and improved adapter retry logic.
- **Error Handling**: Implemented more robust global exception handling for improved application uptime.
- **Calibration Precision**: Addressed baseline stability issues during tare and multi-point calibration.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Brake Mode Integration**: Full support for two-wheeler brake testing and weight monitoring.
- **System Status Panel**: Real-time monitoring of performance, firmware version, and system health.
- **Improved Calibration**: Multi-point calibration system with a dedicated wizard and quality indicators.
- **Bootloader Manager**: CAN-based firmware update functionality with progress tracking.
- **Production Log Viewer**: Advanced logging interface with filtering and export options.
- **Service Registry**: Introduced dependency injection for better service management.
- **Configuration Viewer**: Dedicated window to inspect internal application and system settings.

### Changed
- **UI Refresh**: Significant increase in button sizes and font readability throughout the application.
- **MVVM Refactoring**: Complete restructuring of the application architecture to follow MVVM patterns.
- **Default Settings**: Set default CAN baud rate to 250 kbps for standard industrial compatibility.
- **Firmware Version Display**: Simplified display by removing redundant "FW:" prefixes.

### Fixed
- Resolved critical build errors (CS0106, CS0535) and interface implementation issues.
- Fixed live data dashboard refresh and synchronization problems.
- Removed UI redundancies in filtering settings (EMA filter checkbox).
- Addressed performance bottlenecks in logging and data processing.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Initial Release**: Core WPF application for two-wheeler weight measurement.
- **CAN Connectivity**: Support for USB-CAN-A and PCAN adapters.
